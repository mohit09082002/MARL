## Question 1:
Both Value Iteration and Policy Iteration methods yielded the same optimal policy and very similar optimal values for the states. The policy suggests that the student should focus on attending classes in all states to maximize long-term rewards. This is intuitive, as attending classes in the Academic Building provides the highest immediate reward (+3), and the transitions between states are structured to favor moving towards the Academic Building. The minor differences in value results are due to the iterative nature of the algorithms, but they both converge to the same optimal policy.
